## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. **The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance** - The vehicle length and the ground_clearance. Both of these have extremely small p-value meaning that they had a high level of significance. It also should be noted that the intercept as had a high level of significance meaning that there are still other factors contributing to the variance of the miles per gallon of the MechaCar.
2. **The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero** - This is because the linear regression shows that some of the independent variables had a significant effect on the dependent variable. If none of the independent variables had an effect on the dependent variable then the linear regression would result in a near zero slope.
3. **Does the linear model predicts the mpg of the MechaCare** - at 0.7149 mean that out of 100 instances, this model would approximately predict the mpg of the MechaCar correctly 71 times. This means that the model would be considered effective.
